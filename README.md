# Pac-Man-AI
This project is taken from Berkeley's CS188 class. You can find more information about it [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

Slides on Uniform Cost Search can be found [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fpresentation%2Fd%2F1LS2_Twa4h0xNbTRw2fg5kAEaHMi79CjRidCXKhlYfx8%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=ATPs2ttj-OFBOoGqcLMYoLo8pI0Dtr7tZ3eCc-3_s_Grc89aABnKfTJjsyX_6CAXDOt2irS7iqyVLzvE5iF6AlnSDuYG8uGrrPj0VwPrCYGR1RrFyxGtV5XTsCuX5vMFFyMWJHZ4ZphGuQ).

Search
	Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 
	Used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
	
	Files you'll edit (There are lots of comments to help guide you):
	search.py	Where all of your search algorithms will reside.
	searchAgents.py	Where all of your search-based agents will reside.
	
	You can run bfs using these commands:
	python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
	python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
	python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent
	
	If you want to run bfs add the "-a fn=bfs", e.g. python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
